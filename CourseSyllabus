## Course Description

This is an introductory course on computer programming using the Python language. The course is designed for 8th grade students with no prior programming experience. Over 15 weeks, students will learn fundamental programming concepts like variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions, and objects. Students will apply their knowledge to create interactive programs and games.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand basic programming concepts like variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions
- Read, write, and debug basic Python code     
- Create interactive programs that take user input and produce output   
- Implement algorithms to solve problems through coding
- Apply programming skills to build simple games and applications 
- Work individually and collaboratively on coding projects

## Required Materials    

- Computer with internet access
- Python 3 interpreter (free download from python.org)     
- Python IDE like IDLE or PyCharm (free educational licenses available)  
- Course textbook: *Introduction to Python Programming for Kids* by Jessica Ingrassellino (available in school library)
